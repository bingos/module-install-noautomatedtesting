=head1 NAME

Module::Install::NoAutomatedTesting - A Module::Install extension to avoid CPAN Testers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # In Makefile.PL

  use inc::Module::Install;
  no_auto_test;

The Makefile.PL will exit if it detects that it is being run on a CPAN Tester's C<smoker>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CPAN Testers are great and do a worthy and thankless job, testing all the distributions uploaded to
CPAN. But sometimes we don't want a distribution to be tested by these gallant individuals.

Module::Install::NoAutomatedTesting is a L<Module::Install> extension that will exit from the C<Makefile.PL>
when it detects that it is being run by a CPAN Tester.

=head1 COMMANDS

This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

=over

=item C<no_auto_test>

Does nothing on the author-side. On the user side it detects whether or not automated testing is in effect
and exits accordingly.
