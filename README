NAME
    Module::Install::NoAutomatedTesting - A Module::Install extension to
    avoid CPAN Testers

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      no_auto_test;

    The Makefile.PL will exit if it detects that it is being run on a CPAN
    Tester's "smoker".

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN Testers are great and do a worthy and thankless job, testing all
    the distributions uploaded to CPAN. But sometimes we don't want a
    distribution to be tested by these gallant individuals.

    Module::Install::NoAutomatedTesting is a Module::Install extension that
    will exit from the "Makefile.PL" when it detects that it is being run by
    a CPAN Tester.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "no_auto_test"
        Does nothing on the author-side. On the user side it detects whether
        or not automated testing is in effect and exits accordingly.
